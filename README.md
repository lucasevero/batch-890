Heey beautiful campers from Batch 890! 🤓

Here you can find all the lectures and livecodes from our classes together on Rails and AirBnb week.

Remember, you don't need to keep navegation through this folders on github. You can instead:

simply press the `.` key on your keyboard to open a VS Code enviroment in your browser with the code
clone the repo in you terminal running git clone `git@github.com:lucasevero/batch-890.git`.

If you don't want to lose the updates of the repo you can star it; ⭐

Or just keep running git pull origin master in your cloned directory after classes so you can fetch new code 😉
